# GifTastic

## Function

User can click on the green buttons with different categorys and the page will generate 10 different gifs on the page. User can also add in their own categories. 

## Focus

* contructing DOM elements and spacing them out using Bootstrap/css
* Dynamic AJAX calls
* API usage

## Future Development Ideas

* make the 10 generated gifs to not repeat if the same button has been clicked more than once. 
* add function to change the number of gifs displayed at once.
* play with the layout and orientation
* add more interactions like pinning gifs to a collection
